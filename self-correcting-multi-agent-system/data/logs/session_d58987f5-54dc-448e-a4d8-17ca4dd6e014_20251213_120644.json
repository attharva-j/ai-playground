While Sydney and Melbourne are the largest and most well-known cities in Australia, the capital is actually Canberra. This decision was made to resolve a rivalry between Sydney and Melbourne, and Canberra was chosen as a compromise location. It is situated in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT).\n\n- **Evidence**: This information is widely available in geographical and political references, including government websites and educational resources. For instance, the Australian Government's official website and reputable encyclopedias like Britannica confirm that Canberra is the capital city.\n\n- **Confidence**: 1.0\n\n- **Assumptions**: The assumption here is that the definition of a capital city is the location where the government is based, which is a standard understanding in political geography.",
