      "output": "- **Answer**: The main causes of inflation are demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation.\n\n- **Reasoning**:\n  1. **Demand-Pull Inflation**: This occurs when the demand for goods and services exceeds their supply. When consumers, businesses, and the government collectively demand more than the economy can produce, prices tend to rise. This can be driven by factors such as increased consumer spending, government fiscal stimulus, or rapid economic growth.\n  \n  2. **Cost-Push Inflation**: This type of inflation happens when the costs of production increase, leading to a decrease in the supply of goods and services. Key factors include rising wages, increased prices for raw materials, and supply chain disruptions. When producers face higher costs, they often pass these costs onto consumers in the form of higher prices.\n  \n  3. **Built-In Inflation**: Also known as wage-price inflation, this occurs when businesses and workers expect inflation to continue in the future. As a result, workers demand higher wages to keep up with rising living costs, and businesses increase prices to cover higher wage costs, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of inflation.\n\n- **Evidence**:\n  - **Demand-Pull Inflation**: Historical examples include post-World War II economic booms where increased consumer spending led to higher prices.\n  - **Cost-Push Inflation**: The 1970s oil crisis is a classic example, where oil price shocks led to widespread inflation.\n  - **Built-In Inflation**: This can be observed in economies with persistent inflationary expectations, where wage negotiations and pricing strategies are influenced by anticipated inflation.\n\n- **Confidence**: 0.9\n\n- **Assumptions**: \n  - The explanation assumes a basic understanding of economic principles.\n  - It assumes that the reader is familiar with the general concepts of supply and demand.\n  - The analysis is based on typical economic conditions and may not account for all unique or unprecedented scenarios.",

      "output": "- **Answer**: The main causes of inflation are demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation.\n\n- **Reasoning**:\n  1. **Demand-Pull Inflation**: This occurs when the demand for goods and services exceeds their supply. When consumers have more money to spend, or when there is an increase in government spending, demand can outpace supply, leading to higher prices. This is often associated with a growing economy.\n  \n  2. **Cost-Push Inflation**: This type of inflation happens when the costs of production increase, leading to a decrease in the supply of goods and services. Common causes include rising wages, increased prices for raw materials, and supply chain disruptions. When producers face higher costs, they often pass these costs onto consumers in the form of higher prices.\n  \n  3. **Built-In Inflation**: Also known as wage-price inflation, this occurs when workers demand higher wages, and businesses, in turn, raise prices to cover the increased labor costs. This can create a cycle where wages and prices continuously push each other higher.\n  \n  4. **Monetary Policy**: Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, influence inflation through monetary policy. When a central bank increases the money supply, it can lead to inflation if the increase outpaces economic growth. Conversely, reducing the money supply can help control inflation.\n  \n  5. **Expectations of Future Inflation**: If businesses and consumers expect prices to rise in the future, they may act in ways that contribute to inflation. For example, businesses might raise prices preemptively, and workers might demand higher wages to keep up with expected cost-of-living increases.\n\n- **Evidence**:\n  - **Demand-Pull Inflation**: Historical examples include the post-World War II economic boom, where increased consumer spending led to inflation.\n  - **Cost-Push Inflation**: The 1970s oil crisis is a classic example, where oil price shocks led to widespread inflation.\n  - **Built-In Inflation**: This is often observed in economies with strong labor unions, where wage negotiations can lead to sustained inflationary pressures.\n  - **Monetary Policy**: The role of central banks in controlling inflation is well-documented, such as the Volcker Shock in the early 1980s, where high interest rates were used to curb inflation in the US.\n\n- **Confidence**: 0.9\n\n- **Assumptions**: \n  - The explanation assumes a basic understanding of economic principles.\n  - It assumes that the reader is interested in a general overview rather than a deep dive into economic theory or models.",

Each of these causes can be influenced by various factors such as monetary policy, supply chain disruptions, and expectations of future inflation.\n\n- **Reasoning**:\n  1. **Demand-Pull Inflation**: This occurs when the demand for goods and services exceeds their supply. It is often driven by strong consumer demand, increased government spending, or expansive monetary policy that increases the money supply. When more money chases the same amount of goods, prices tend to rise.\n  \n  2. **Cost-Push Inflation**: This type of inflation happens when the costs of production increase, leading to a decrease in the supply of goods and services. Common causes include rising wages, increased prices for raw materials, and supply chain disruptions.

By adjusting interest rates and controlling the money supply, they can either stimulate or cool down the economy. Loose monetary policy can lead to higher inflation if it results in excessive money supply growth.\n  \n  5. **External Factors**: Global events, such as oil price shocks or geopolitical tensions, can also cause inflation.
