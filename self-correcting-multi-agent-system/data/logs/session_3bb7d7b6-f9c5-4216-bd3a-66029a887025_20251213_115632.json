      "output": "- **Answer**: Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that the state of one particle directly influences the state of the other(s), regardless of the distance separating them. A practical application of quantum entanglement is in quantum cryptography, specifically in Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). However, current limitations include technological challenges in maintaining entanglement over long distances and the need for highly controlled environments.\n\n- **Reasoning**:\n  1. **Definition of Quantum Entanglement**: Quantum entanglement occurs when particles interact in such a way that their quantum states become interdependent. This means that the measurement of one particle's state will instantaneously determine the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are. This phenomenon is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics and challenges classical intuitions about locality and separability.\n  \n  2. **Practical Application - Quantum Cryptography**: One of the most promising applications of quantum entanglement is in the field of quantum cryptography. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) uses entangled particles to securely distribute encryption keys. The security of QKD is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, which ensure that any attempt to eavesdrop on the key distribution process will disturb the quantum states, thus revealing the presence of an intruder.\n  \n  3. **Current Limitations**:\n     - **Distance**: Maintaining entanglement over long distances is challenging due to decoherence, where interactions with the environment cause the entangled state to degrade. Current QKD systems are limited to relatively short distances, typically up to a few hundred kilometers, without the use of quantum repeaters.\n     - **Technological Complexity**: The equipment required to generate, maintain, and measure entangled states is complex and expensive. This includes the need for precise control over the quantum systems and the environment to prevent decoherence.\n     - **Scalability**: Scaling up quantum networks to a global level requires significant advancements in technology, including the development of quantum repeaters and satellite-based systems.\n\n- **Evidence**:\n  - Quantum entanglement is well-documented in scientific literature, with foundational experiments such as those by Alain Aspect in the 1980s providing empirical support (Aspect et al., 1982).\n  - Quantum Key Distribution has been successfully demonstrated in various experiments and is commercially available in limited forms (e.g., BB84 protocol).\n  - Current research papers and reviews discuss the challenges of decoherence and the development of quantum repeaters (e.g., Briegel et al., 1998).\n\n- **Confidence**: 0.9\n\n- **Assumptions**:\n  - The reader has a basic understanding of quantum mechanics.\n  - The explanation focuses on a high-level overview without delving into complex mathematical formulations.\n  - The practical application example is chosen based on current technological feasibility and relevance.",

This phenomenon defies classical intuitions about locality and separability.\n  \n  2. **Mechanism**:\n     - When particles become entangled, their properties such as spin, polarization, or momentum become correlated. For example, if two entangled particles are created such that their total spin is zero, measuring the spin of one particle as \"up\" will immediately result in the other particle's spin being \"down\".\n  \n  3. **Practical Application - Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**:\n     - QKD uses entangled particles to create a secure communication channel. The most well-known protocol is BB84, which uses the principles of quantum mechanics to ensure that any eavesdropping on the communication can be detected. Entangled particles are used to generate a shared, secret key between two parties, which can then be used to encrypt and decrypt messages.\n  \n  4. **Current Limitations**:\n     - **Distance**: Maintaining entanglement over long distances is challenging due to decoherence, where interactions with the environment cause the entangled state to break down.\n     - **Technological Constraints**: Current technology requires highly controlled environments, such as cryogenic temperatures and vacuum conditions, to maintain entanglement.\n     - **Scalability**: Scaling up the number of entangled particles for practical, large-scale applications is still a significant challenge.\n\n- **Evidence**:\n  - **Scientific Literature**: Numerous studies, such as those by Aspect et al. (1982) and more recent experiments, have demonstrated entanglement and its non-local properties.\n  - **Technological Developments**: Companies like ID Quantique and research institutions are actively developing QKD systems, with some commercial implementations already in use.\n  - **Limitations**: Research papers and reviews, such as those by Pirandola et al.

However, current limitations include technological challenges in maintaining entanglement over long distances and the need for highly controlled environments.\n\n- **Reasoning**:\n  1. **Definition of Quantum Entanglement**: Quantum entanglement occurs when particles such as photons, electrons, or atoms become linked, and the quantum state of one particle cannot be described independently of the state of the other(s). This means that a change in the state of one particle will instantaneously affect the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are.\n  \n  2. **Mechanism**: When two particles are entangled, measuring a property (like spin or polarization) of one particle will immediately determine the corresponding property of the other particle. This phenomenon was famously described by Einstein as \"spooky action at a distance.\"\n\n  3. **Practical Application - Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**: \n     - **How it Works**: QKD uses entangled particles to create a secure communication channel.
