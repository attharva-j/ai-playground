When consumers have more money to spend, or when there is an increase in government spending, demand can outstrip supply, leading to higher prices. This is often described as \"too much money chasing too few goods.\"\n  \n  2. **Cost-Push Inflation**: This type of inflation happens when the costs of production increase, leading to a decrease in the supply of goods and services. Common causes include rising wages and increased prices for raw materials. For example, a spike in oil prices can lead to higher transportation and production costs, which are then passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.\n  \n  3. **Built-In Inflation**: Also known as wage-price inflation, this occurs when workers demand higher wages and, in response, businesses increase prices to cover the higher wage costs. This can create a cycle where wages and prices continuously push each other up.\n\n- **Evidence**:\n  - **Demand-Pull Inflation**: Historical examples include post-war periods where pent-up consumer demand led to inflationary pressures.\n  - **Cost-Push Inflation**: The 1970s oil crisis is a classic example, where oil price shocks led to widespread inflation.\n  - **Built-In Inflation**: This is often observed in economies with strong labor unions where wage negotiations lead to regular wage increases.\n\n- **Confidence**: 0.9\n\n- **Assumptions**: The explanation assumes a basic understanding of economic principles and does not delve into more complex factors such as monetary policy, exchange rates, or global economic conditions that can also influence inflation.",

      "output": "**Answer**: The main causes of inflation are typically categorized into demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation. Each of these causes can be influenced by various factors such as monetary policy, supply chain disruptions, and expectations of future inflation.\n\n**Reasoning**:\n1. **Demand-Pull Inflation**: This occurs when the demand for goods and services exceeds their supply. It is often driven by strong consumer demand, increased government spending, or expansive monetary policy. When more money is available in the economy, consumers and businesses are likely to spend more, leading to higher demand and, consequently, higher prices.\n\n2. **Cost-Push Inflation**: This type of inflation happens when the costs of production increase, leading to a decrease in the supply of goods and services. Key factors include rising wages, increased prices for raw materials, and supply chain disruptions. For example, if the price of oil rises, transportation and production costs increase, which can lead to higher prices for goods and services.\n\n3. **Built-In Inflation**: Also known as wage-price inflation, this occurs when businesses and workers expect inflation to continue in the future. As a result, workers demand higher wages to keep up with rising costs, and businesses increase prices to maintain profit margins, creating a self-sustaining cycle of inflation.\n\n**Evidence**:\n- **Demand-Pull Inflation**: Historical examples include periods of economic expansion where consumer confidence and spending increase, such as the post-World War II economic boom.\n- **Cost-Push Inflation**: The 1970s oil crisis is a classic example, where oil price shocks led to widespread inflation.\n- **Built-In Inflation**: This can be observed in economies with persistent inflation, where expectations of future inflation are factored into wage negotiations and pricing strategies.\n\n**Confidence**: 0.9\n\n**Assumptions**:\n- The explanation assumes a basic understanding of economic principles.\n- It assumes that the reader is interested in a general overview rather than a detailed economic analysis.\n- The causes are considered in a typical economic context without extreme external shocks or policy interventions.",

When a central bank increases the money supply or lowers interest rates, it can lead to higher inflation if the economy is already operating at or near full capacity.\n  \n  5. **Expectations of Future Inflation**: If businesses and consumers expect prices to rise in the future, they may act in ways that contribute to inflation. For example, businesses might raise prices in anticipation of higher costs, and workers might demand higher wages to keep up with expected price increases.\n\n- **Evidence**:\n  - **Demand-Pull Inflation**: Historical examples include the post-World War II economic boom, where increased consumer spending led to inflation.\n  - **Cost-Push Inflation**: The 1970s oil crisis is a classic example, where oil price shocks led to widespread inflation.\n  - **Built-In Inflation**: This is often observed in economies with strong labor unions that can negotiate higher wages, leading to a wage-price spiral.\n  - **Monetary Policy**: The role of central banks in controlling inflation is well-documented, such as the Federal Reserve's actions during the 1980s to combat high inflation in the U.S.\n  - **Expectations**: The concept of inflation expectations is a key component of modern economic theory, influencing both policy and market behavior.\n\n- **Confidence**: 0.9\n\n- **Assumptions**: \n  - The explanation assumes a basic understanding of economic principles.\n  - It assumes that the reader is interested in the general causes of inflation rather than specific case studies or regional variations.",
