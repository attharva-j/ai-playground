  "context": "",
  "final_answer": "- **Answer**: NASA was established in the year 1958.\n\n- **Reasoning**: To determine the year NASA was established, we need to look at the historical context of space exploration in the United States. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was created as a response to the Soviet Union's advancements in space technology, particularly after the launch of Sputnik in 1957. The U.S. government recognized the need for a dedicated agency to oversee and advance American efforts in space...",
